title: Adding conda to path for command line access
---

I installed Anaconda3 using the GUI installer. Turns out, I forgot to check some option that links conda to terminal!
Fix: add conda to path! See https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18675907/how-to-run-conda
Update: easier to configure the terminal to run conda, for example:
~/opt/anaconda3/bin/conda init zsh
